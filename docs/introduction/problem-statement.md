# Problem Statement

## The Current Landscape

### 1. The Trust Deficit
Renters rarely know who they are dealing with.
- **Landlords**: Struggle to vet tenants efficiently.
- **Tenants**: Fear deposit scams or dealing with unresponsive slumlords.

### 2. The mismatch of Lifestyles
Most classified sites (Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace) focus on the *property* (Price, Location), completely ignoring the human element.
- **Result**: Night owls paired with early risers. Neat freaks paired with messy roommates.
- **Consequence**: High turnover, disputes, and stress.

### 3. Disconnected Workflows
The rental journey is fragmented:
1. Search on Portal A
2. Chat on WhatsApp
3. Pay via Bank Transfer
4. Track expenses on Excel

### 4. Lack of Data for Owners
Landlords operate in the dark, with little insight into:
- Competitive pricing in their area.
- Tenant demand trends.
- Financial performance over time.
