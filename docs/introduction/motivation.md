## Why We Built StayMate

Finding a place to live is stressful. Finding the *right people* to live with is even harder.

In today's urban housing market, renters face a "wild west" scenarios:
- **Scams**: Fake listings and unverified landlords.
- **Incompatibility**: Moving in with strangers often leads to lifestyle conflicts (cleanliness, noise, schedules).
- **Fragmentation**: Using one app to find a flat, WhatsApp to chat, and spreadsheets to track bills.

**StayMate was born from a simple idea:**
> What if finding a roommate was as intelligent and safe as a modern dating app, but for housing?

## The Vision

We envision a world where:
- **Safety is Default**: Every user and property is verified.
- **Compatibility is Science**: AI analyzes lifestyle habits to potential conflicts before they happen.
- **Transparency is Key**: No hidden costs, no fake profiles.

StayMate isn't just about filling empty rooms; it's about creating **homes** where people thrive together.
